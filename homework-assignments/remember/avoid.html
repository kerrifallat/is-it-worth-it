"THROUGH IT.<br>
 NOT<br>
OVER IT."<br>

<p>
For as long as I can remember my work has always centered around<br>
the essential inquiry of how trauma penetrates the depths of the soul and psyche.<br>
How does trauma reshape both your external and internal environments entirely?<br>
 How does trauma reconfigure your relationship to your own body?<br>
 How does it intervene in your connections to others?<br>
My work does not strive to answer these large questions in the slightest but more so<br>
explore them through the lens of individuals other than myself.<br>
For some reason, what sticks firmly in my mind is a scene in Finding Nemo when Dory and Marlin are confronted<br>
with a haunting and eerie underwater trench.  They argue back and forth about whether they should go through the trench or go over it for quite sometime.<br>
Despite, Dory's reassurance to Marlin<br> 
that they will go through the uncertainty that lays within the trench together, Marlin continues to attempt<br>
 to convince Dory that going over the trench is the best choice.<br>
This notion of going through or over is big driver in my body of work.<br>
In Val Walker's book, 'The Art of Comforting: What to Say and Do for People in Distress,' she discusses the struggle society has of viewing trauma more <br>
so as a disease or injury that is in desperate need of being immeaditely cured and as something to "get over" with ease.<br>
 If only it were that simple.<br>
I crave for the masses to experience true community through their struggles.<br>
Society has carefully mapped out and pushed onto those suffering, a council that's soley made up of doctors, therapists, pastors and self help books.<br>
They treat trauma and mental illness the same as a physical injury.<br>
"With the right medication and professional support you'll get better soon," they promise.<br>
 But what's important in this phrase in not the fake and artificial nature behind these empty words<br>
but looking more closely at a two single words in particular.<br>
Instead of being nurtured and having attempts made to grow research and<br>
evolve understandings surrounding trauma, individuals are told three of the most hurtful words,<br>
 in the English language.<br>
<br>
"Get over it."<br>
Who knew that these three simple words could<br>
cut<br>
so deeply beyond <br>
skin, veins, and blood.<br>
The sad truth is there is no immeadiate cure or recipe<br>
for healing from trauma because like so many other things in life once it caresses<br>
 you with it icy and weighted grip it doesn't let go.<br>
 It becomes embedded in your structure.<br>
Becoming intertwined with your genetic makeup.<br>
 Uninvitedly shifting the ways you make choices,<br>
 take action and speak words from that day forward.<br>
 It's a load that you eventually learn through trail and error how to balance on your aching and buckling spine.<br>
But why is so much of this learning process done alone?<br>
 Why does this journey have to take place through isolation?<br> 
<br>
THIS.<br>
<br>
This is what I try to avoid most.<br>
<br>
You pace around your room which is littered with dirty laundry,<br>
 partially drank water bottle and crushed beer cans.<br>
 Your naked feet step gingerly on used tissues,<br>
 paper plates as you lock eyes with a deteriorating sandwhich<br>
 that has been rotting in your room all week. You're too tired to toss it in the garbage <br>
 can that hauntingly waits with a pile of dishes in the musty sink for you downstairs. <br>
 Why bother texting Tanya, Tony or Tim?  They're busy with their jobs, their relationships, their families and they have plenty of their own shit already<br>
 taking up space on their plates so why would you want to add more?<br>
Or better yet why would you want to bring them down with discussing the miserable reality<br>
 that you call your life when there's seem to be going so well? Ravaged and exhausted by all these questions,<br>
 you collapse back into your unmade bed that wreaks of sweat, tears and whatever meals you ate that week in front<br>
 of the TV that never seems to have anything good on. <br>
 Your eyes circle around the dusty corners of your room,<br>
from pile to pile<br>
 of unattended clothing and trash.<br>
You decide maybe today will be different.<br>
Maybe today I'll make a change to this depressing routine<br>
and get out of my funk.  Your hands paw for a book that's stuffed underneath your bed. <br>
 You stretch your fingertips to reach it, your body refusing to remove itself from its fixated laying positioning on the slumped mattress.<br>
 Finally feeling the slippery and glossy cover brush against your pinkie,<br>
you clench your teeth as you wrap your fingertips around the book.<br>
 You raise it up to meet your eyes, tracing your fingers along the satiny feeling white pages,<br>
 gazing at the 12 point times new roman text that populates the page.<br>
'HOW TO CHANGE YOUR ROUTINE'<br>
It reads in all caps at the top of the page.<br>
Your eyes shakily make their way down the lines,<br>
each one feeling more hollow and empty than the last.<br>
<br>
THIS.<br>
<br>
This is what I try to avoid most.<br>
<br>
I want to prevent and help others from feeling this crushing and plummeting meteor of abandonment.<br>
I want to begin a never ending conversation of how we can comfort one another more tenderly in these moments.<br>
I want to remind others that they are not the only ones struggling or having these intrusive thoughts.<br>
I want to be the Dory to their Marlins,<br>
reassuring them that going through the underwater trench may be scary, <br>
but with another beside you, supporting you along the way it will be alright.<br>
