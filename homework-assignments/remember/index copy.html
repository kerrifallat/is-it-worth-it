Soft Entanglements

the <m>
  comfort drapes
</m>  over my bent knees as I sit curled up in bed.  My eyes fixed on blarring screen.
its okay though because at least I am met with friendly smiles.
My legs, knees and ankles feel stiff and unmoving compared to the soft entanglments that the bed comforter provides.
Even the wires that emerge from being tucked behind the left lower corner of my bed seem to mirror the comforter's gentle movements.
The laptop on my lap generates heat quickly.  Warming and toasting the surface of the comforter. My neck feels fixed and hunched ove.
I feel like the tin man from wizard of oz when dorothy first discovers him.
Where the fuck is my oil god damn it.
Its funny to think that my own body could serve as a juxaposition to the soft entanglements that the wires and bed comforter express.
My cat seems to merge with the texture of the comforter.
Becoming a soft entanglement in himself.
He sits next to me.
He farted.

<small>
  Small waves
</small>
 of sharp diamond shapes fill the back and front side of the bed comforter.
A thick gray outline borders the diamond shape while small white colored dotted lines emphasize its form. <br>
A second smaller white diamond like shape is flattly colored into the negative space behind its chunky gray outlines.
When I stare at the sea of geometric patterns my eyes feel dizzy.
Somehow a single pointed shape feels less intimidating than the massive cluster of them that I am presented with in my periphrial.

detail three:

  <strong>
    <inks>
      the foot of the bed
    </inks>
  </strong>

The foot of the bed feels miles away from my shriveled and hunched over mash of what I like to call my body. <br>
the left corner is much more frumpy and messy looking to gaze at then the right.
The right corner almost gives off the impression that the comforter was quickly hauled over the mattress in hopes to present a sense of tidiness.
The left corner reveals phone and laptop wires, slung over a stuffed monkey in their path.
When thinking about the distance between myself and the foot of the bed, it almost reminds me of how it feels to first approach the ocean.
You look out towards the crashing and violent or still and calm waves, pondering when the best time would be to take a shaky step forward.
Once the thought trickles through your brain it sends a message down the body. <br>
Starting from your head, to your neck, to your shoulder, chest, tummy, legs and then finally your toes that are now sinking in the slippery sand.
You yank one out, then raise your eyes to meet an incoming wave and then decide to wait a bit longer.
and the process repeats.
