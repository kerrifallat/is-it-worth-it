<h1>
  Diving Deeper into 3 Details:
</h1>
<mark>
  <strong>
<p>
  Detail One:<br>
  <mark>
    Soft Entanglements
    <strong>
</p>
</strong>
  </mark>
<p>
the <m>
  comfort drapes
</m>  over my bent knees as I sit curled up in bed.  My eyes fixed on blarring screen.<br>
its okay though because at least I am met with friendly smiles.<br>
My legs, knees and ankles feel stiff and unmoving compared to the soft entanglments that the bed comforter provides.<br>
Even the wires that emerge from being tucked behind the left lower corner of my bed seem to mirror the comforter's gentle movements.<br>
The laptop on my lap generates heat quickly.  Warming and toasting the surface of the comforter. My neck feels fixed and hunched ove.<br>
I feel like the tin man from wizard of oz when dorothy first discovers him.<br>
Where the fuck is my oil god damn it.<br>
Its funny to think that my own body could serve as a juxaposition to the soft entanglements that the wires and bed comforter express.<br>
My cat seems to merge with the texture of the comforter.<br>
Becoming a soft entanglement in himself.<br>
He sits next to me.<br>
He farted.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>Detail Two:</p>
<br>
<br>
<mark>
  <strong>
Geometric patterned
     </strong>  
</mark>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<small>
  Small waves
</small>
 of sharp diamond shapes fill the back and front side of the bed comforter.
A thick gray outline borders the diamond shape while small white colored dotted lines emphasize its form. <br>
A second smaller white diamond like shape is flattly colored into the negative space behind its chunky gray outlines.
When I stare at the sea of geometric patterns my eyes feel dizzy.
Somehow a single pointed shape feels less intimidating than the massive cluster of them that I am presented with in my periphrial.

<br>
<p>Detail Three:</p>
<mark>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>

    The foot of the bed
   
  </strong>
  
</mark>
<p>

The foot of the bed feels miles away from my shriveled and hunched over mash of what I like to call my body. <br>
the left corner is much more frumpy and messy looking to gaze at then the right.<br>
The right corner almost gives off the impression that the comforter was quickly hauled over the mattress in hopes to present a sense of tidiness.<br>
The left corner reveals phone and laptop wires, slung over a stuffed monkey in their path.<br>
When thinking about the distance between myself and the foot of the bed, it almost reminds me of how it feels to first approach the ocean.<br>
You look out towards the crashing and violent or still and calm waves, pondering when the best time would be to take a shaky step forward.<br>
Once the thought trickles through your brain it sends a message down the body. <br>
Starting from your head, to your neck, to your shoulder, chest, tummy, legs and then finally your toes that are now sinking in the slippery sand.<br>
You yank one out, then raise your eyes to meet an incoming wave and then decide to wait a bit longer.<br>
and the process repeats.<br>
<br>
