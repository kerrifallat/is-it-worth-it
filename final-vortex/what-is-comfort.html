<h1>What is Comfort?</h1> 
   <p>
    What is comfort?<br>
    <br>
     I whisper quietly to my restless soul as I am engulfed by<br>
    <br>
    flames of darkness that set my viens on fire.<br>  
    <br>
    Is it a tight hug,<br>
    <br>
    one where you and the other person’s hearts kiss gently and unisonly sing a thumping and mirroring melody?<br>
    <br>
    Is it the meeting of two pairs or more of kind and welcoming eyes?<br>
    <br>
    Is it sharing a hearty laughs with good friends?<br>
    <br>
    Is it being able to both tolerate and enjoy<br>
    <br>
     a still and silent moment with one another?<br>
     <br>
    Or Is it being able to endure<br>
    <br>
     the agony of expressing vulnerability in the presence<br>
     <br>
    of a secondary body?<br>
    <br>
    What is comfort?<br>
    <br>
    Could it be a considerate friend offering you a warm bowl of your favorite soup<br>
    <br>
     when you’re feeling ill?<br>
    <br>
    Could it be a companion to walk with<br>
    <br>
    and stare at the bare <a href="wind-chimes.html">winter</a> branches with?<br>
    <br>
    Could it be a pal who scheduled the <a href="to-slow.html">time</a><br>
    <br>
    to call you on the phone once a week?<br>
    <br>
    Could it be taking a warm bath and enjoying solitude?<br>
    <br>
    Could it be the tender embrace of a fluffy throw blanket wrapped around your body?<br>
    <br>
    What is comfort?<br>
    <br>
     What is Comfort?<br>
     <br>
    I whisper quietly to my restless soul as I am engulfed<br>
    <br>
     by flames of darkness that set my viens on fire.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
