  <h1>BEING PRESENT</h1>
  <p>
    is it easier to be still or to move?<br>
    What tracks movement?<br>
    is it measured through time?
    In terms of how long it takes to get from point a to point b?<br>
    Or is it tracked through the duration it takes for the thought to pop into the brain, then travel down to the <br>nerves, telling your feet to take one step forward or one step back?<br>
    What is it to stand still?<br>
    to be still?<br>
    What is it to move?<br>
    What are the differences between movement and to move?<br>
    Could stillness being sitting in your unmade bed in deep contemplation questioning every decision you’ve <br>
    ever made in your lifetime or would this somewhat hermit feeling mode be concerned movement?<br>
    
    Questions, thoughts and feelings blurt out into your psyche, setting the thoughts in motion.<br>
    
    to take action on these or to not, becomes a central inquiry.<br>
    
    But this ricochet of elements that make us purely and soley human, could this still moment be considered <br>
    movement too? even if the thoughts, feelings and questions haven’t yet transfigured into a blueprint or a <br>
    plan of action?<br>
    
    I wonder.<br>
    
    There are four parts with me always.<br>
    
    The wounded child.<br>
    
    The adaptive child.<br>
    
    The wiser adult.<br>
    
    And X.<br>
    
    I like to think that the wounded child is given the assignment to be still.<br>
    
    The wounded child after all is constantly thinking, feeling and questioning her surroundings but is far too <br>
    frightened and unsure of how to move these fragments from the brain to the outside world.<br>
    
    This is where the adaptive child comes.<br>
    
    The adaptive child is entirely action programmed.<br>
    
    While the wounded child ponders and cries, drowning in the pool of unresolved emotions and screaming <br>
    questions, the adaptive child is called upon to take the reins.<br>
    
    The adaptive child is rebellious, short tongued, and quick.<br>
    
    Consequences never seem to be in her peripheral as she will strive to take on the task on movement for the<br>
     sake of protecting the wounded child.<br>
    
    The wiser adult seems to fluctuate between being still, moving and facilitating tasks to these two.<br>
    
    But wiser adults core job has always been and always will be to comfort the two so things don’t get out of <br>
    hand.<br>
    
    Stop.<br>
    
    Go.<br>
    
    Take a breath.<br>
    
    Take a step back.<br>
    
    I’ll take it from here.<br>
    
    She says to them as patiently as she possibly can.<br>
    
    Last and not least is X.<br>
    
    X is a fourth part that is tucked away and dormant a majority of the time.<br>
    
    Only arising to say cruel and command hurtful tasks from all three.<br>
    
    It is only when X comes out that I realize that the wise adult seems to yield something only describable by <br>
    the term super power.<br>
    
    All at once she can remain both still and fixed in movement at the same time.<br>
    
    She rushes to hug and embrace the child, reassuring them that nothing bad will happen.<br>
    
    She wards off X.  Telling him that although his demands seem enticing, action is not an option.<br>
    
    She does all this while staying still.<br>
    
    Her feet firmly on the ground.<br>
    
    But all the while, while her physical body remains in a fixed positioning, her mind moves excessively, <br>
    keeping everyone in check.<br>
    
    I once again ask what does it mean to be still and what does it mean to be in movement?<br>
