The illuminating tv screen bares illusive, outdoor scenes.<br>
A quarter to 2 AM, the blocky text of the right lower corner of the screen reminds me.<br>
The floorboards squeak, marking each of my gentle footsteps towards the window.<br>
I part the two long and dragging lavender curtains, revealing the firmly closed window that's eyes appear to be tightly shut through the indication of the lumpy, white shade.<br>
I slowly raise the blanket from its pupils.<br>
Revealing an unusually bright scene for night.<br>
The pine tree wave a gentle "good evening to me."<br>
I am bewildered at the laminating cool blue and white sparkly shades that decorate the floor of the neighborhood.<br>
<a href="glittering-dust.html">Glittering Dust</a> sits happily on pools, porches and streets.<br>
I wonder to myself how it could possibly be night time with how brightly lit the atmosphere seems to be.<br>
My restless fingers curl around the lip of the window.<br>
With all my strength, I yank it slightly open, just to feel the chilly kiss of the wind and smell the indescribable smell of the cold (snow).<br>
The window's mouth sits open about an inch, inviting in a strong and fierce breeze that blows the once still sitting purple curtains.<br>
My eyes soak up the glittering and bright redecorated environment, in awe.<br>
Other than the humming of the wind, the scene remains quiet for moment until the gentle ringing and soft clashing of distant wind chimes reverberate into the space.<br>
I try to guess how many wind chimes could be involved in such a poetic act.<br>
A performance they have put on, just for me.<br>
This is surely a silver lining to insomnia.<br>
You get to share these indescribably beautiful and endearing experiences with no one else but the moon, the snow, the trees, the wind chimes.<br>
A part of me almost pities those who are nestled and tucked tight in their beds.<br>
Oh how they may never be given such a gift.<br>
I tip toe back to my bed, hearing <a href=the-mattress.html>the mattress</a> let out a squeak as my body sinks into the bed.<br>
My body falls back.<br>
The pillow absorbs and hugs my tired head.<br>
My eyelids begin to close, as I lay there still, listening the songs of the wind chimes of the neighborhood, curious about where they all live, hanging, as they play their melody.<br>
