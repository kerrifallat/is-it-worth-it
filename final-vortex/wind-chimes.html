The illuminating tv screen bares<br>
illusive scenes of the outdoors.<br>
2:40 AM,<br>
the blocky, glowing white text<br>
positioned at the lower right corner of the screen reminds me.<br>
The floorboards squeal and giggle,<br>
with each impression of flesh<br>
as I inch my way closer <br>
towards the firmly closed portal.<br>
My fingertips curl,<br>
grasping the two long and dragging lavender curtains, revealing the tightly shut mouth of the window.<br>
A <a href="portals.html">window </a>could easily pass as a articulately crafted<br>
take on the human form<br>
or<br>
perhaps,<br>
a face<br>
entirely its own.<br>
Its sleepy eyelids remain shut,<br>
and<br>
unflinching,<br>
through the indication of the lumpy shades.<br>
With the sturdy and gentle<br>
guidance of my <br>
clutched hands,<br>
It sluggishly opens its mystic and wide pupils,<br>
offering an electrifying and unexpected <br>
gift<br>
 of an unusually <br>
bright and clear night sky.<br>
The pine trees sway,<br>
 as if they are whispering a quiet and kind, â€œgood evening" to me.<br>
I am bewildered at the sight.<br>
Overlays of cool toned shades of blue and <br>
<a href="glittering-dust.html">glittering Dust</a>
 decorate<br>
the floor of the neighborhood.<br>
The euphonious winds tenderly peck at me with<br>
 chilly kisses.<br>
My nostrils fill with the<br>
indescribable scent of the winter snow.<br>
Like sponges,<br>
my gaze absorbs<br>
the twinkling seas of snowflakes<br>
that sit calmly<br>
 upon the rooftops of nearbyhomes<br>
that I could never afford.<br>
The choir-like hums of the wind soften,<br>
leaving behind<br>
delicate,<br>
fragmented<br>
abstractions of<br>
melodies from<br>
the clashings of distant wind chimes.<br>
Their sounds reverberate,<br>
penetrating through the open mouth of the window.<br>
I try to guess how many wind chimes could be involved in such a poetic act.<br>
A backstage performance,<br>
they have put on,<br>
just for me.<br>
A part of me almost<br>
pities those who are nested and tightly snuggled in their beds.<br>
As I tiptoe back towards my frompy <a href="the-mattress.html">mattress,</a><br>
I think to myself that<br>
this is<br>
surely a silver lining to <a href="sleepless-nights.html">insomnia.</a><br>
