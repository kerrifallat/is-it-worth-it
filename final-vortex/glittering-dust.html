    <h1>GLITTERING <br>DUST</h1> 
  </div>
  <p>
  Octagonal shaped flakes ejected from the skies's watering mouth-<br>
  <br>
  Decorating and blanketing the world simultaneously.<br>
  <br>
  The once plain and bland lanscapes of the front lawn had been transfigured into a stage<br>
  <br>
  where mother nature herself was displaying an artistic and poetic performance all her own.<br>
  <br>
  The bare trees became fashion models<br>
  <br>
  striking unique and organic poses<br>
  <br>
  in their new sparkling threads.<br>
  <br>
  The snow flurries also seemed to putting on a show of their own-<br>
  <br>
   waltzing and dancing in good spirits with one another before <br>
   <br>
  gentling trickling to the ground<br>
  <br>
   where they would become merged and mashed with one another.<br>
