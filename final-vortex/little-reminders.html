    Fourteen little reminders.<br>
    I say each one out loud as<br>
    I ditch each circular tablet<br>
    that sits in my clammy palm.<br>
    Tossing them one by one<br>
    into the swirling toilet bowl.<br>
    They Brush into my mind.<br>
    Nudging me<br>
    in remembering that it feels good to be alive.<br>
    <br>
    The saxophone solo in Ray Charles’s ‘Hard Times’<br>
     that feels like warm honey poured on the soul.<br>
    The sensation of the heat</a>of the sun kissing your skin for the first time<br>
    after the long and weary winter months.<br>
    A  silly expression or string of words from my niece.<br>
    The inexplainable and overwhelming rush of completing an artwork—<br>
     and actually feeling proud.<br>
    The sound of shells turning amongst the <a href="the-ocean-poem.html"> ocean</a>floor when you float on the backside amongst the sea's surface.<br>
    A gentle warm breeze encountered during an April stroll.<br>
    The invitation of rest, movies and slumber a rainy day offers. <br>
    The fuzzy snuggles with a <a href="cats.html"> cat.</a><br>
    The <a href="scents.html"> scent</a> that lingers in the air before rainfall.<br>
    The smell of hot dogs sizzling on the grill in July.<br>
    Gingerly stepping into a warm bath and <a href="body.html"> the body</a>wave of heat and endorphins that flood the brain.<br>
    A good horror flick that vacations in your head<br>
    for days,<br>
    leaving you in a state of curiosity and wonder<br>
    as you attempt to unravel its plot.<br>
    An unexpected phone call from an old friend<br>
    that you didn’t know how much you needed.<br>
    The buzzing sensation when inspiration hits.<br>
    All these things<br>
    and more—<br>
    Become and are<br>
    Reminders<br>
    That it feels good to<br>
    Be alive.<br>
    <br>
