<h1>Little Reminders</h1>
<p>
    Fourteen little pills.<br>
    Fourteen little reminders.<br>
    I say each on out loud as<br>
    I ditch each circular tablet<br>
    that sits in my palm.<br>
    Tossing them one by one<br>
    into the swirling toilet bowl.<br>
    They Brush into my mind.<br>
    Nudging me<br>
    in remembering that it feels good to be alive.<br>
    The saxophone solo in Ray Charles’s ‘Hard Times’ that feels like warm honey poured on the soul.<br>
    The sensation of the heat of the sun kissing your skin for the first time  after the long and weary winter months.<br>
    A  silly expression or string of words from my niece.<br>
    The inexplainable and overwhelming rush of completing an artwork—<br>
     and actually feeling proud.<br>
    The sound of shells turning amongst the ocean floor when you float on the ocean’s surface on your back.<br>
    A gentle warm breeze encountered during an April stroll.<br>
    The invitation of rest, movies and slumber a rainy day offers. <br>
    The fuzzy snuggles with a cat.<br>
    The scent that lingers in the air before rainfall.<br>
    The smell of hot dogs sizzling on the grill in July.<br>
    Gingerly stepping into a warm bath and the body wave of heat and endorphins that flood the brain.<br>
    A good horror flick that vacations in your brain for days, leaving you in a state of curiosity and wonder as you attempt to unravel the its plot.<br>
    An unexpected phone call from an old friend that you didn’t know how much you needed.<br>
    The buzzing sensation when inspiration hits.<br>
    All these things<br>
     and more—<br>
    Become and are<br>
    Reminders<br>
    That it feels good to<br>
    Be alive.<br>
    <br>
