  <h1>A FAREWELL</h1>
  <p>
  Unfortunately our time has come to an end.<br>
  I hope you travelers enjoed the many winds and bends.<br>
  I may be optimistic in hoping that you hold onto how life can be so rich when you engage with<br>
  the pretend.<br>
  Go ahead and run.<br>
  Go ahead and fly.<br>
  And please don't ever stop imagining or<br>
  contemplating questions that begin with "why's".<br>
