<h1>A Jumbled Collection of Thoughts during Writing</h1>
<p>
 
 listening to music/building visual narratives inside my mind/replaying specific songs over and over again<br>
refining the storyboard in my mind with each click of repeat of the song/going for a walk/stretch/
replay these<br>
 songs once more/
close eyes/visualize the story/who are the characters/what is the environment/what is the narrative<br>
 about/starting to get a feel for all the details/urgency creeping in/must record the thoughts in some way before they leave/<br>
speedily typing into my notes app/draw the characters out/no that heads not right/another try/thicker lines damnit/okay this feels right/<br>
fuck! why wont this pen work/alright deep breaths/maybe drawing is too much/making a physical list/ah that makes my brain smile and feel the order/<br>
maybe a bubble chart?/writing the first string of words/reading it back/you used that word a little to much to the theasaurus we go!/
ah thats better/okay/<br>
typing out a couple more sentences/reading it out loud/more vulnerable!/shifting the words around/what is your combination!!!???/<br>
back to the theasaurus, lets go/dictionary.com where are u???/typing and refining the messy chunk of words/reading it out loud once more/yeah yeah<br>
we are getting there man/
what are they wearing in this scene?/are they wearing anything at all/man i could really use another word for genitals right about now/glossing over the blob of writing<br>
 once more/
why am i such a god damn failure/hmmm should I start smoking cigs again?/pondering/NAHHH/okay maybe a glass of wine will get the words flowing/<br>
okay maybe one more/yes yes YES!/reading the writing out loud once more/okay this feels right/this feels good/checking the time/<br>
ah man it is getting pretty late/do i keep going?/i'm always better in the mornings/yeah it is past 10p.m/sleep sounds good/setting alarm for the morning/<br>
