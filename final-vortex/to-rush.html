    <h1>TO RUSH</h1>
    <p>
      I rush to wake up.<br>
      I rush to gobble down my breakfast.<br>
      I rush to throw on my flimsy, stupid clothes that look “the part.”<br>
      I rush to stuff my backpack with gizmos and gadgets.<br>
      I rush to check once,<br>
      I rush to check twice,<br>
      I rush to check a total of three times<br>
      that I have my wallet,<br>
      that I have my keys,<br>
      that I have my phone,<br>
      everything I need.<br>
      I rush to insert my key into my car ignition.<br>  
      I rush to get quickly to my destination.<br>
      I rush through my contemplations and reflections on the long day that looms over me ahead.<br>
      I rush  through my fantasies of what my dream life could be.<br>
      I rush through visual images of sitting by the sand and sea.<br>
      I rush to pack up When its time to go  once more.<br>
      I Continuing my rushing<br>
      all the way home,<br>
      I rush through  glasses of wine,<br>
      and thinking deeply about my fears.<br>
      I rush through thoughts of danger that may be lurking near.<br>
      I rush through dinner,<br>
      and I rush through washing my face.<br>
      I rush through brushing my teeth,<br>
      I rush through curiousities about outter space.<br>
      I rush to lay my head down on the pillow,<br>
      when the day is finally done.<br>
      Only to wake up and rush all over,<br>
      pretending this pace is normal and fun.<br>
