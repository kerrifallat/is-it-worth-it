    <h1>TO RUSH</h1>
    <p>
    Long ago a professor in a summer course of mine on world religions drew my attention to something.<br>
    This something runs through my mind<br>
    like legs on a treadmill.<br>
    He called to attention how much of the human experience is a rushing one.<br>
    We rush to wake up.<br>
    We rush to gobble down our breakfast.<br>
    We rush to throw on flimsy clothes that look "the part."<br>
    We rush to pack up our gizmos and gadgets.<br>
    We rush to check once, twice,<br>
    three times total sometimes<br>
    that we have our phone,<br>
    our wallets<br>
    and our keys.<br>
    We rush down the busy streets to get to our destination.<br>
    We rush through our long and grueling days.<br>
    We rush through our fantasies of what our dream lives would be<br>
    and what they would look like.<br>
    When its time to go we rush to pack up once more.<br>
    Continuing to rush home,<br>
    Rush through dinner or our glasses of wine<br>
    or quite frankly whatever our unwinding activities may be.<br>
    We rush to bed.<br>
    Ready to rush all over again once more the next day.<br>
