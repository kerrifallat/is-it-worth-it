  <h1>Morning Sun</h1>
  <p>
A crisp frosting of dew laid over the vividly green grass<br>
in the early morn.<br>
A nosy sun smiles at me, parting the trees,<br>
with its light,<br>
peaking through the little negative space that budding branches provide.<br>
The grassâ€™s color alternates-<br>
tipping scales of<br>
a cool, virvidian green shade and<br>
a bright and soft yellowish green tone.<br>
Cardinals become modern day social lites,<br>
As they gather on the tree branch that hovers above the damp lawn.<br>
They jabber feverishly to the other flocks of birds that sit listening, excitedly.<br>
The birds that have not cliqued up to join in on recieving the juicy scoop of gossip hum beautiful and repetitive melodies<br>
in the distance.<br>
I sit in my rocking chair with my coffee mug,<br>
watching the morning unfold.<br>
My lips curl into a genuine smile,<br>
Harmonously.<br>
