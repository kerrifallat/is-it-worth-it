   <h1>Contradictions Within Healing</h1>
 <p>
I  yearn for warm embraces.<br>
I am starving for <a href="love.html">love</a><br>
 But yet-<br>
 In the same moment-<br>
 almost simultaneously-<br>
I crave for nothing more<br>
 than the cold gnaws<br>
 of solitude.<br>
These repetive collections,<br>
 And clusters,<br>
Active Hubs<br>
of<br>
emotions and<br>
sensations<br>
is<br>
alnd always will be<br>
in my mind<br>
the product that trauma reproduces<br>
over and over again.<br>
Not wanting to impose<br>
but in the same moment<br>
swallowing screams.<br>
cries for love<br>
asking to be heard<br>
And to be seen<br>
but yet<br>
within the same frame of time-<br>
I wish for nothing more than<br>
The cloak of invisibility,<br>
Of noramlity,<br>
Of Sanity.<br>
I yearn for the mundane,<br>
The boring,<br>
The predicatable,<br>
Normalcy<br>
But yet<br>
These yearnings have proven time and time<br>
again<br>
To be but mere dreams,<br>
illusions,<br>
slipping through my fingertips.<br>
I grasp at them all the same however,<br>
watching them dissolve between the  gaps between my<br>
lanky and aching<br>
fingers.<br>
