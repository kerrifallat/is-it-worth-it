  <h1>Welcome To The Votex!</h1>
   <p>
    Hello fellow Traveler!<br>
    It is my pleasure to officially extend an invitationâ€”<br>
    From me to you<br>
     to the Vortex.<br>
    Everyday portals open and close.<br>
    They expand,<br>
    They magnify,<br>
    Through written, typed or spoken words.<br>
    <a href="Windows.html">Windows</a> to unique and varying realities & fantasies unlatch,<br>
    Granting us both the permission and possibilities to explore, build and dive ourselves within them.<br>
    With all this being said, I encourage you to now go forth,<br>
    To discover and scout.<br>
    Decipher where YOU believe these realms begin,<br>
     Where they end,<br>
    Or where they merge.<br>
    Interact with them however you choose,<br>
    And please feel free to take a look around.<br>
    Do not be afraid to get <a href="lost.html">lost</a><br>
    Or to find fragments of your own realities & illusions<br>
    Lingering inside them.<br>
    Good luck on your adventure,<br>
    Farewell for now.<br>
    
   </p>
