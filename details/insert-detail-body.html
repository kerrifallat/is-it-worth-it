What makes up a body?
<br>
What sets it into
<bdi>
    motion? 
</bdi> 
<br>
What keeps it still?
<br>
Currently my body hunches over in obsure position as I lean into the glowing keys of my keyboard.
<br>
My body seems to be stuck in a lagging loop of time, exisiting somewhere between still and movement.
<br>
One gray, fuzzy pillow sits beside me to my left, slumped in a similar awkward and uncomftorable stance.
<br>
The pillow almost appears to sneaking a peak towards my keyboard as I write.
<br>
Not in a judgemental way, but a curious one.
<br>
My spine yelps.
<br>
Screaming in agony and pain, as it settles once more into a j curved shape.
<br>
What makes up a body?
<br>
What sets it into motion?
<br>
What keeps it still?
<br>
What is movement?
<br>
what is stillness?
<br>
Can both occur simulatenously?
<br>
As I slightly curl my toes towards me, I think about how the act began with a thought, blurting out into my brain, then sending a message trickling down to the nerves, then to the muscles, the bones and all that lays in between to move forward.
<br>
Is this chain reaction of thoughts shifting to actions considered the movement more so than my toes moving back and forth?
<br>
I wonder.

 <p2>
     Stacks of loose, crinkled papers.
     <br>
     <large>
        Mountains
     </large>
     <small>
        of books.
     </small> 
     <br>
     Fragments of glittering jewelery and stones.
     <br>
     Piles of pillows, lumped together on the left side of the bed.
     Two fluffy.
     One sleek.
     One worn.
     <br>
     Bags of dirty laundry, stuffed in the corners to hide.
     <br>
     Paper bags, package boxes, gift bags from the holidays mashed underneath the desk.
     <br>
     Clusters of things everywhere.  What a mess!
     <br>
     Old and new candles, sitting shoulder to shoulder.
     <br>
     Paintings, collages, drawings and more are meshed together on the purple, bed room walls.
     <br>
     Dust wads hanging off the fan and from the glass shards on paintings of bathtub scenes.
     <br>
     four portfolios, kissing against the wall behind the door.
     <br>
     An old dial phone, two ceramic pillars, and a red, flower shaped glass bowl sit in a nook.
     <br>
     Skeletons in meditative states of thoughts, birthday cards, and a heart shaped dish populate the nook diagnol from the one with the pillars, bowl, and phone.
     <br>
     A bundle of shoes are scattered and mashed both at  once next to the tv stand.
     <br>
     More empty boxes nest together.
     <br>
     Evidence of over spending and using objects to fill the void.
     <br>
     Clusters upon clusters, upon clusters.

<p3>
   Stormy seas seem to have taken hold of my room.
   <br>
   Wobbly and unpredictable waves of worn clothing, pillows, art supplies, candles, jewels, cigarette packs and more have come crashing over the space.
   <br>
   I take cover on the<em>
       bed.
   </em> 
   
   <br>
   The only floating life preserver avalaible in these violent and uncertain waves.
   <br>
   I am gasping for air.  suffocating in the chaotic mess of debrew that it all leaves behind.
   <br>
   A destructive force, the waves can be.
   <br>
   But how I love when they are calm and soft, like snowflakes on the tongue.
   <br>
   When the clothes are folded, tucked away.
   <br>
   When the half drank wine glasses, empty cigarette packs and other trash are thrown away.
   <br>
   The way the carpet looks after a machine has combed over it, leaving traces of its prescenes through the patterning of the fibers in the rug.
   <br>
   Oh how I love and crave for the waves to be calm.
   <br>
   But as I stated before, they can be quite unpredictable in their fierce and powerful nature.
   <br>
   The way they transform a space, obliterating all the was and making the environment something entirely, new and orginal.
   <br>
   I love the way treasures become washed up on the carpet, emerging from the piles.
   <br>
   Reminds me of the way one seeks out shells and assigns value to each one.
   <br>
   Reminds me of the process of choosing which shells to tuck into your pockets and which ones to leave behind for the seas to gobble up.
   <br>
   I must admit that although I thoroughly enjoy the stillness and serenity that the calm waves bring me, there is something about the forcefulness of discovery and contemplation that I love about the chaotic and unpredictable stormy seas and crashing waves.
   <br>
Waves.
<br>
Waves.
<br>
Waves.
<br>
You come and go, but the nature of your prescene is never known and there is something magical about that.
