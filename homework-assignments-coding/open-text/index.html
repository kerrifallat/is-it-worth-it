<h1>
	Winter Skies
</h1>
<h2>By: Kerri Fallat</h2>

<p>
The winter sun<br>
 swells and shrivels<br>
Rises and falls–<br>
Painting the pale and gloomy atmosphere<br>
 with scattered swatches<br>
And slabs<br>
 Of exquisite and<br>
sometimes undiscovered<br>
colors.<br>
Many may have not been named yet<br>
Labels have not yet been assigned<br>
Nor have they been sorted into<br>
Neat and tidy<br>
categories or<br>
Families<br>
Bearing fancy and definitive brands.<br>
Their sole existence and–<br>
the act of viewing their bold streaks<br>
And stains in the <br>
Skies<br>
Almost feels like a revolutionary act.<br>
<br>
<br>

I may bare the unpopular opinion that winter skies are– <br>
By far<br>
 more alluring than<br>
Any other heaven present<br>
Out of the four seasons<br>
<br>
<br>


That slumped and thirsting<br>
Body of yours<br>
craves<br>
To be met with luster rays of <br>
Sunlight<br>
But<br>
The languid blue-violet sacks of flesh<br>
That inflate and droop simultaneously<br>
Underneath your fatigued eyes<br>
match the winter skies-<br>
perfectly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Winter is misinterpreted.<br>
Winter is misunderstood.<br>
Days mutate into nights quickly<br>
Layers upon layers ought to be worn-<br>
Daily.<br>
Thick, lumpy coats seem to<br>
Both mask and<br>
Disguise the<br>
Feeble skeleton from the<br>
Harsh bites of the<br>
cold.<br>
<br>
<br>
A time to burrow into <br>
Pillow forts<br>
Bundles of blankets<br>
Oversized sweaters<br>
The inner psyche.<br>
<br>
<br>
A time to cook<br>
A time to boil.<br>
<br>
<br>
The marinating of ideas that have been<br>
Squirreled away<br>
Suddenly coming forth that were <br>
initially<br>
Tucked away <br>
During the fun, joyful and busy<br>
warmer days.<br>
<br>
<br>

“In the middle of Florida in the middle of the night after you<br>
Step off the plane you see the swamps morph<br>
Into the mountains of your childhood<br>
They raise their heads like giants<br>
The Sierras stare; do not go there”<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>1.4)</strong>
“Continue to drive through hornets and testicular small towns<br>
Some flags raised<br>
Some flags down<br>
The god of the underworld has let you go from his hand<br>
Into the empire Floridian<br>
He says you have a pure heart<br>
So pure he cannot destroy it<br>
Some people look pure but they are not<br>
<br>

He says he cannot see you destroy yourself so he has let you<br>
	go<br>
And he will protect you with his anger and melancholy<br>
<br>

It will hurt<br>
You know this<br>

“You are not wrong, who deem<br>
That my days have been a dream;<br>
Yet if hope has flown away<br>
In a night, or in a day,<br>
In a vision, or in none,<br>
Is it therefore the less gone?<br>
All that we see or seem<br>
Is but a dream within a dream.”<br>

Two sentences from “Rejection of Closure” That stood out to me: (include page number)
<i>"Writing’s initial situation, its point of origin, is often characterized and always complicated by opposing impulses in the writer and by a seeming dilemma that language creates and then cannot resolve.  The writer experiences a conflict between a desire to satisfy a demand for boundedness,for containment and coherence, and a simultaneous desire for free, unhampered access to the world prompting a correspondingly open response to it."</i>

<strong>Answers to Discussion Questions:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<li>
  <strong>
1.)
  </strong>When considering the political implications of both "open" and "closed" texts, it is essential to look at their definitions, similarities, and differences. Open texts are compositions of words that evoke multiple meanings through elements of the form(spacing, placement, punctuation, arrangement/rearrangement), language selections (choosing words that marry direction and language, repetition), and subject. Closed texts are strings of words that direct the reader to a single, fixed meaning. Open text can lead to more extensive inquiries and form philosophical or creative ideologies regarding the many factors that penetrate the human experience. In her text, 'The Rejection of Closure,' Lyn Hejinian suggests these questions could encompass themes of gender, identity, complicated social structures, authority, patriarchal power, and control. However, the closed text minimizes the possibilities of these questioning of politics and ethics, though they are clinging to providing a singular interpretation. I feel that closed texts can limit readers' imaginations at times, thus making the process of digesting the material a far more linear mode of participation than the circular nature of the open text. The open text could very well be a revolutionary act because it encourages the reader to seek a multitude of meanings and could birth multiple ideas with it that would put the oppressive social structures that mark our world at stake.

  <strong>
2.1)
  </strong>
   Although  Hejinian notes that there are both positive and negative models for closure, I feel that by rejecting closure through text, you as a writer are urging the reader to more actively engage and interact with the text. This energetic and thoughtful triple date between the writer, reader, and the text, can open doors for new perspectives on subject matters, the reader/text interaction, and language itself. While closed text takes the opportunity to simplify and make the message clear through its formation, language, and content choices, it can close off the gifts that stem from open text and the lack of closure it provides.

  <strong>
    3.)
  </strong>
  Some devices that  Hejinian offers to "open" a text include rearrangement, arrangement, repetition, compositional techniques that create gaps, looking critically at language selection regarding directions such as horizontal and vertical, inside, outside, or up and down. By embracing and reenacting the movement we experience in the world, these elements open the door for interpretations of those choices and their meanings. They invite readers to connect the text to real or fictional things.
