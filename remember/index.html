<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would close my eyes, feeling sucked and catapulted into the whirring dizzy spells of the dark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everything around me would become obliterated, drawn to this warranted and yet unwarranted portal that I had foolishly opened with the single pressing question of ‘how did it feel to be dead?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would feel the inescapable sensation of falling backwards, except no one would be there to catch me, therefore I would just be floating in the abyss of my mind, stuck on this thought.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I strived to plunge myself out of the dreary realm that was and still remains to be my mind, I realized that some things are better off not being wondered about.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remember feeling dizzy by imagining how obliterating it would be for everything to suddenly cut to black.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remember how every time I thought about dying at 8 years old I would feel the sensation of falling backwards, except no one would be there to catch me.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I remember too that this was the first time I realized that some things are better off not being wondered about, pried apart and torn open like a slit in a flimsy plastic garbage bag. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
