      Recently, I have come to discover a new truth in my reality.<br>
      Nearly 90 percent of days have all been boiled down to rushing-<br>
      what is required to feed it and calm it.<br>
      I rush to wake up.<br>
      I rush to click on the coffee maker until it bares the singular and powerful phrase, “Ready to Brew.”<br>
      I rush to grab a mug with shaky fingertips from the cabinet, sliding it underneath the spout of the machine.<br>
      My hands jitter and twitch.<br>
      Could this be an aftereffect of rushing or <br>
      a yearning to be victualted with the stiff and hollow, artificial fuel to<br>
      journey through the overarching and exhausting seeming collection of hours that was my day.<br>
      A cigarette is pressed between my lips.<br>
      I rush to inhale.<br>
      I rush to exhale.<br>
      my morning self-beating monologue even seems to be trapped in a rushed manner.<br>
    <i>  “Can’t believe its been nine years already and I’m still smoking these things”<br></i> 
  <i> “Can’t believe how chilly it is this morning”<br></i>
     <i> “How am I ever going to be able to quit?”<br></i>
    <i> “It’s going to be a long day”<br></i>
  <i> “I need to grab another pack before heading off to the train,”<br></i>
      The thoughts exit and enter my brain like a revolving door on 3x speed as I rush to sip my coffee.<br>
      I rush to slip on my clothes,
      I slide on the same frumpy sweatshirt from the night before-<br>
      The very same article of clothing I wore while<br>
      rushing to get to sleep the night prior.<br>
      I rush to shove and stuff my backpack with commodities:<br>
      notebooks, pens, highlighters, packets, my laptop and endless entanglement of chargers and cords.<br>
      I rush to wedge my feet into my shoes.<br>
      I rush to shimmy and shake into my big, puffy winter coat.<br>
      I rush to grab my car keys.<br>
      I rush my goodbyes to my mom.<br>
      I rush to disappear out the door.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      My hands grip the steering wheel, and I begin to feel that familar sticky and sweaty physical sensation that I know far too well.<br>
      My throat is parched.<br>
      The coffee has finally entered my bloodstream, it seems.<br>
      I rush to the train station parking lot.<br>
      I rush to park my car in the first vacant spot I see,<br>
      regardless of my checkings of the temperatures for later that evening, when I will arrive to rush once more-<br>
      Home.<br>
      I rush to que up the pay-to-park app on my phone.<br>
      I rush to resituate my train tickets to the front section of the fanny pack-<br>
      The one that I rush to snap on, into place,<br>
       that hugs my waist and excitedly pulses with each rushing step I take.<br>
      I rush to the empty train platform.<br>
      I rush to leap off the painted yellow line and onto the train cart.<br>
      I rush to sit down in the first open seat my eyes interlock with.<br>
      My body is slumped, in a still positon<br>
      For the moment-<br>
      But my mind is still caught rushing.<br>
      When the train arrives, I rush off the cart, with my backpack slung over my aching shoulders and my fannypack flopping from side to side.<br>
      I rush past the Starbucks,<br>
      The 7-11<br>
      The Dunk’in Donuts<br>
      And the pointy, haunted looking church on the far left corner.<br>
      I rush up the ramp to the civil square building.<br>
      I rush to approach my classroom.<br>
      I rush to sit down<br>
      And to stand back up to go to the bathroom<br>
      I rush back to open up my laptop<br>
      So I can continue to rush through my work.<br>
      I rush through the hours of the day in my head, thinking about my bed, my cat and a warm bowl of soup.<br>
      When the hours brush past, I rush back towards the train.<br>
      Rushing up the six flights of step.<br>
      Rushing back onto the train cart.<br>
      Rushing back to my car.<br>
      Rushing back to my home.<br>
      Just so I can rush through dinner,<br>
      Rush through my glass of wine,<br>
      Rush through my meditation session,<br>
      Rush to get into my pajamas,<br>
      All so I can rush to sleep<br>
       so I can wake up to rush through the next day.<br>
      <br>
